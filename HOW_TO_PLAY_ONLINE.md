## How to Play "The Game"

### Goal
Work together to play all cards (2-99) onto 4 piles before running out of moves.

### The 4 Piles:
- **2 Ascending piles**: Start at 1, play higher numbers (2, 3, 4...)
- **2 Descending piles**: Start at 100, play lower numbers (99, 98, 97...)

### Special Rule:
You can play a card that's **exactly 10 lower** on ascending piles or **10 higher** on descending piles.

### Your Turn:
1. **Play at least 2 cards** (1 card when deck is empty)
2. Click a card from your hand
3. Click which pile to play it on
4. Click **"End Turn"** when done

### Team Communication:
- Use the chat to give hints: "I can help with the 60s pile"
- **Don't say exact numbers!** That's against the rules ðŸ˜‰

### Win/Lose Together:
- **Win**: All cards played successfully
- **Lose**: Someone can't make a valid move
